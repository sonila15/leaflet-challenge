## Visualizing USGS Earthquake Data with Leaflet

### Introduction
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) collects a massive amount of earthquake data from all over the world each day but lacks a meaningful way of displaying it. The purpose of this project is to create an interactive map that visualizes USGS earthquake data and provides additional information about earthquakes through popups.

### Technologies used
* Leaflet
* HTML
* JavaScript

### Installation and Setup
* Create a new repository for this project called `leaflet-challenge`.
* Clone the new repository to your computer.
* Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Leaflet challenge. Use the folder name : `Leaflet Part-1`
* Download the necessary files from the `Module 15 Challenge files`.
* Unzip the downloaded file and move the `earthquakes_past7days.json` file into the `Leaflet-Part-1` directory.

### Create the Earthquake Visualization
* Visit the `USGS GeoJSON` Feed page and choose a dataset to visualize.
* Use the URL of the chosen JSON dataset to pull in the data for the visualization.
* Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
* Reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.
* Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
* Create a legend that will provide context for your map data. 

### Deployment
The application is deployed on GitHub Pages at https://sonila15.github.io/leaflet-challenge/. The source code is available in the repository at https://github.com/sonila15/leaflet-challenge/.
